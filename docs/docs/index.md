# What is this?

http-response is a free web API that makes it possible to generate HTTP responses.  
It features fake data generation and repetition of list items.

Example use cases:

- Generate fake data while prototyping
- Test that your application behaves correctly given a certain response
- Mock API responses

Generate responses either by using a GET request and defining the response through query string parameters, or by using a POST request and defining the response through a JSON payload.
