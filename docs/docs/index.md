# What is this?

http-response is a free service that makes it possible to create HTTP responses "on the fly" either by using a GET request and defining the response through query string parameters, or you can use a POST request and define the response through a JSON payload.

It also makes it possible to generate dummy data and to generate
lists of data by repeating items.
